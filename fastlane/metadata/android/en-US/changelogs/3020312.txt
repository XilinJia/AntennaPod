 Version 6.15.3

* setting play state menu is reversed (Ignored on top, Unplayed at bottom)
* when setting an episode state to Played or Ignored, the played position is reset to 0
* in Import/Export settings, there is a new Combo Import/Export
	* it handles Preferences, Database, and Media files combined or selectively
	* all are saved to "Podcini-Backups-(date)" directory under the directory you pick
	* on import, Media files have to be done after the DB is imported (the option is disabled when importing DB is selected)
	* individual import/export functions for Preferences, Database, and Media files are removed
	* if in case one wants to import previously exported Preferences, Database, or Media files,
		* manually create a directory named "Podcini-Backups"
		* copy the previous .realm file into the above directory
		* copy the previous directories "Podcini-Prefs" and/or "Podcini-MediaFiles" into the above directory
		* no need to copy all three, only the ones you need
		* then do the combo import
* import/export of OPML, Progress, and HTML stay as individual operations
	* Note, progress import/export was useful when migrating from Podcini 5 as the DB can not be imported into Podcini.R, it's not needed when you can import a DB
	* I'm not sure how useful are the HTML exports
* navigations in PreferenceActivity are performed in Compose
* VideoMode dialog is in Compose
* removed the need for versions catalogue for gradle
